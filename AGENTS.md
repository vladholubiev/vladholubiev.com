Avoid building components whose behavior relies heavily on external boolean props. Instead, **compose your UI from smaller, self-contained building blocks**, each handling a specific responsibility. When variations emerge, simply adjust the composition rather than introducing conditional logic. **Lift shared state into context providers** to decouple state management from your UI components. This ensures your components remain declarative, intuitive, and maintainable as your application scales.
