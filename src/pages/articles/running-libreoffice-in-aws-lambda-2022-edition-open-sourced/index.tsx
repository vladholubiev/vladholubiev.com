      <Heading level={2}>History</Heading>
      
      <p>Exactly 5 years ago, I wrote about <a href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/how-to-run-libreoffice-in-aws-lambda-for-dirty-cheap-pdfs-at-scale-b2c6b3d069b4">running LibreOffice in AWS Lambda</a>{' '}
      for the first time. It enabled people to generate PDFs from any office file format for a fraction of a dollar.
      As opposed to a traditional server-based approach, it utilizes serverless computing to drastically reduce costs and get better stability.
      Each Lambda invocation gets a fresh runtime environment, so users benefit from not having to worry about frozen zombie processes or memory leaks.</p>
      
      <p>The original approach was based on compiling a LibreOffice build specifically suited for the
      AWS Lambda execution environment (with many Linux libraries missing) and packaging it as a Lambda layer.
      It can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/vladholubiev/serverless-libreoffice">https://github.com/vladholubiev/serverless-libreoffice</a></p>
      
      <p>Since then, a lot of things changed in the AWS Lambda landscape.
      Lambda got native Docker support, higher memory limits, expandable /tmp space, etc.</p>
      
      <p>The most common problems observed with the original approach were:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Stripped out LibreOffice build lacked many features and supported fewer file formats than a standalone desktop build.</li>
        <li>No fonts or emoji support.</li>
        <li>Limited disk space available for converting large files, since a layer consumed ~50% of the /tmp space.</li>
        <li>A complex process of upgrading to a new version due to constraints of the AWS Lambda&apos;s provided environment.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <Heading level={2}>A New Approach Was Born</Heading>
      
      <p>To address those problems, I wrote a new version based on Docker and compiled it with the latest LibreOffice 7.4.
      The setup is a bit more involved, but it&apos;s more flexible, easier to maintain, and produces better-quality outputs.
      Some of the benefits:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>The size limit of the compiled LibreOffice increased from 512 MB (Lambda layer limitation) to <strong>10 GB</strong> — meaning less
        stuff needs to be stripped out from the LibreOffice package.
        The new base image is 877 MB in size.</li>
        <li>More repeatable build — by utilizing Docker for the build process, it&apos;s much easier
        to replicate a build locally and upgrade to new LibreOffice versions.</li>
        <li>Ability to install fonts or other LibreOffice extensions — my base image already includes CJK fonts!</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The outcome of this is:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>a base Docker image, that you can use to package your Lambda function Docker image with
        the latest LibreOffice and its dependencies installed, ready to be used for PDF generation.</li>
        <li>a helper utility node.js library to help invoke LibreOffice commands to do file conversion.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Check them out:</strong></p>

      </ul>
      
      <p>Bonus tip: by default, Lambda allocates 512 MB of <code>/tmp</code> space for your Lambda.
      When converting larger files, you might need more space.
      Since March 2022, it&apos;s now possible to extend the <code>/tmp</code> space to 10 GB! See the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-lambda-now-supports-up-to-10-gb-ephemeral-storage/">blog post</a>.</p>
      
      <Heading level={2}>How to Use It</Heading>
      
      <p>If you are already bundling your Lambdas as Docker images, the setup should be familiar to you.
      If not — check out the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images-create.html">AWS Documentation</a> on the topic.</p>
      
      <p>It starts with adjusting your Dockerfile.
      By default, when you&apos;re building a Docker image for your Lambda, you base it off the official AWS image like this:</p>
      
      <ShikiHighlighter
        language="dockerfile"
        theme="github-dark"
        showLanguage={false}
        addDefaultStyles={true}
      >
        {`FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/nodejs:16-x86_64`}
      </ShikiHighlighter>
      
      <p>What you need to do instead, is to change this line to the base image for Node.js 16 with LibreOffice:</p>
      
      <ShikiHighlighter
        language="dockerfile"
        theme="github-dark"
        showLanguage={false}
        addDefaultStyles={true}
      >
        {`FROM public.ecr.aws/shelf/lambda-libreoffice-base:7.4-node16-x86_64`}
      </ShikiHighlighter>
      
      <p>Next, you finish your Dockefile with the usual bundling steps:</p>
      
      <ShikiHighlighter
        language="dockerfile"
        theme="github-dark"
        showLanguage={false}
        addDefaultStyles={true}
      >
        {`COPY handler.js \${LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT}/
CMD [ "handler.handler" ]`}
      </ShikiHighlighter>
      
      <p>I&apos;ll skip the rest of the steps needed, like building the image, pushing it to the ECR repository,
      etc, as it&apos;s out of the scope of this article.
      You can find tutorials on that online, as well as in the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images-create.html">AWS Docs</a>.</p>
      
      <p>So now, by changing the base image of your Lambda, you are able to execute LibreOffice commands in your Lambda!
      Here is an example that creates a dummy TXT file and converts it to PDF:</p>
      
      <ShikiHighlighter
        language="javascript"
        theme="github-dark"
        showLanguage={false}
        addDefaultStyles={true}
      >{`const {execSync} = require('child_process');
const {writeFileSync} = require('fs');
module.exports.handler = () => {
  writeFileSync('/tmp/hello.txt', Buffer.from('Hello World!'));
  execSync('cd /tmp && libreoffice7.4 --headless --invisible --nodefault --view --nolockcheck --nologo --norestore --convert-to pdf --outdir /tmp ./hello.txt');
};`}</ShikiHighlighter>
      
      <p>If you want a more high-level API around LibreOffice rather than fiddling with the commands like <code>libreoffice7.4 --headless</code>,
      check out <a href="https://github.com/shelfio/aws-lambda-libreoffice">https://github.com/shelfio/aws-lambda-libreoffice</a>. It provides API like this:</p>
      
      <ShikiHighlighter
        language="javascript"
        theme="github-dark"
        showLanguage={false}
        addDefaultStyles={true}
      >
        {`const {convertTo} = require('@shelf/aws-lambda-libreoffice');
convertTo('document.docx', 'pdf'); // returns /tmp/document.pdf`}
      </ShikiHighlighter>
      
      <p>The library handles specifics of the Lambda environment, like saving files to the only writable path <code>/tmp</code> and cleaning up residual files.</p>
      
      <Heading level={2}>Summary</Heading>
      
      <p>Thousands of people used the original 2017 build of LibreOffice for Lambda to run their production workloads.</p>
      
      <p>And now, there is a new, recommended way of running LibreOffice in AWS Lambda.
      It utilizes Docker instead of Lambda layers.
      It has the latest LibreOffice version compiled and CJK fonts support.</p>
      
      <p>Right now, there is a pre-built base image for Node 16 environment, but it could be easily extended to support more languages.
