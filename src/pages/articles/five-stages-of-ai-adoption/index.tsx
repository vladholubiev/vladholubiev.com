      <p>
        When engineering teams face disruptive tech, emotions often mirror the classic five stages
        of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Denial</strong> kicks in first. Engineers dismissed GPT-2 as a joke because it
        couldn&rsquo;t replace human-level tasks. This skepticism wasn&rsquo;t logic - it was
        self-preservation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next comes <strong>anger</strong>, disguised as practical objections. &ldquo;The code it
        generates is messy,&rdquo; or &ldquo;It needs constant oversight.&rdquo; Valid criticisms,
        sure - but temporary. Soon the tool improves, and arguments fade.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then engineers start <strong>bargaining</strong>. They let AI handle basic work, fiercely
        holding onto complex tasks. But soon, complexity isn&rsquo;t safe either, and they begin
        losing ground to increasingly capable AI. The line between what&rsquo;s yours and
        what&rsquo;s the AI&rsquo;s gets blurry.
      </p>

      <p>
        Quietly, <strong>depression</strong> sets in. It surfaces as apathy. Engineers who once
        eagerly explored new tools now settle for what&rsquo;s good enough. Behind this lies the
        uncomfortable realization: AI does some of what you once valued, maybe even better.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, <strong>acceptance</strong> arrives. The team adapts - not begrudgingly, but
        practically. AI isn&rsquo;t the enemy; it&rsquo;s a collaborator. Acceptance doesn&rsquo;t
        mean giving up - it means seeing clearly. Roles shift from pure creation to critical
        refinement. Engineers become directors of solutions rather than authors of code.
      </p>

      <p>
        We should anticipate these stages, guide teams through emotional turbulence, and acknowledge
        the real loss people feel when cherished skills become less relevant. The reward? A team
        ready to leverage AI&rsquo;s potential instead of fighting it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Adopting AI isn&rsquo;t just about technology. It&rsquo;s about navigating emotional
        resistance. Recognize the stages, address them head-on, and your team won&rsquo;t just
        survive - they&rsquo;ll thrive.
